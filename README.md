### File Transfer
A basic program with a tkinter GUI that allows the user to select a source directory and a destination directory, and then transfers only files that have been modified in the last 24 hours.

### Web Page Generator
Another basic tkinter GUI program that allows the user to generate a default HTML page or one with custom text.

### Phonebook
A more complex program using tkinter and sqlite3. Allows the user to add entries consisting of first and last name, phone number, and email address, which are saved to a database using sqlite3. The entries are shown as a list in the GUI by first and last name, users can click on names in the list and either edit or delete them.

### Django Hotel Site
A partial mockup of a hotel website using Django. The main feature of this project is the Admin page where a list of products can be viewed, created, edited, or deleted.

### Django Checkbook Site
Another mockup of a website using Django. This site allows users to create accounts and then enter transactions which are added up and can be shown on a balance page.
